Fake HoloLenz Gate is a poor man's HoloLenz Gate.

[HoloLenz Gate](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?v=eCKs38tR6ZU&event=video_description&redir_token=3_MKNjaXcrFrY7cwqRv41nEX2t58MTUxNjE2ODI0M0AxNTE2MDgxODQz&q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fja-jp%2Fstore%2Fp%2Fholelenz-gate%2F9pjkj8mtjmjf) is a superb app for a HoloLens made by [@VoxekKei](https://twitter.com/voxelkei). It allows you to open the door to another world in midair. Unfortunately I can't afford to pay for a HoloLens, so I made this Fake HoloLenz Gate using [three.ar.js](https://github.com/google-ar/three.ar.js).

Please try the app in a [WebARCore](https://github.com/google-ar/WebARonA...) on your Pixel or Pixel 2 Android Phone.
